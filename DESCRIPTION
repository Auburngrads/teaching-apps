Description: Instantly create shiny app templates and app calling functions 
    for use in R packages.  Manage large collections of shiny apps from one 
    location.  Update the structure or appearance of apps on the fly.  Nest 
    small apps together to create complex 'storyteller' apps. Publish stand-
    alone apps or embed in rmarkdown documents with app calling functions.
    Includes over 100 shiny apps and shiny gadgets for analyzing data and   
    teaching various concepts (statistics and R programming).
