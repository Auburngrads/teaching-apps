Description: The teachingApps package is a collection of functions aimed at 
    making it fast and easy for anyone to build, use, and share shiny apps.
    The initial purpose behind creating the package was to provide a single
    repository from which I could publish and present the shiny apps I use 
    during my lectures.  Before creating this package I found that I was using
    the same apps in multiple presentations, which forced me to keep the app 
    updated in multiple places.
