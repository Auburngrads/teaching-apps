#' @description Mathematics and/or statistics are part of nearly every course 
#' in any technical degree program. \code{LaTeX, code} \code{reduce overlap}.
#' The teachingApps project is first and foremost a software package of pre-built, 
#' interactive applications that instructors can include in their existing teaching 
#' materials to describe and visualize math/stat concepts.  More importantly, teachingApps 
#' is an open-source infrastructure allowing subject matter experts to collectively
#' their content to improve the quality of each app.
