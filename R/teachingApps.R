#' @description Math and statistics (math/stat) are part of nearly every course 
#' in any technical degree program. In many of these courses, math/stat is not the 
#' primary subject but is used to support a student's understanding of a physical concept. 
#' physics, and chemistry.  learning are not courses
#' in math/stats \code{LaTeX, code} \code{reduce overlap}.
#' 
#' teachingApps is a software package for crowd-sourcing the creation of 
#' web apps to make teaching math/stats faster and easier. The goal
#' of the package is to help both students and instructors by 
#' 
#' A) Presenting four layers of information simultaneously:
#' 
#'    - Math/Stats concepts through interactive visualizations
#' - Computer programming skills - with R (Python coming soon)
#' - LaTeX equation typesetting with <a target=' ' href='https://www.mathjax.org/'>MathJax</a>
#' - App development using HTML5, CSS3, and <a target=' ' href='http://shiny.rstudio.com/'>Shiny
#' 
#' The teachingApps package was initially created to help statistics
#' instructors integrate JavaScript-based visualizations into their existing
#' materials.  To date, more than 130 completed apps have been built into the 
#' package to explain/visualize topics such as
#' 
#' - maximum likelihood estimation
#' - confidence interval construction
#' - random variable sigma-algebra
#' - Explained error in linear regression
#' - Central Limit Theorem
#' - Censored and Trucated data
#' - Over 20 probability distributions  
#' 
#' 
#' open-source R & Python
#' interactive, crowd-source math/stat
#' 
#' #' teachingApps brings several packages together to make it possible provide best 

#' and teach
#'  collection of interactive applications designed to help instructors explain
#' several math/stat conceptscan include in their existing teaching 
#' materials to describe and visualize math/stat concepts.  More importantly, teachingApps 
#' is an open-source infrastructure allowing subject matter experts to collectively
#' their content to improve the quality of each app.
#' 
#' merge content, javascript applications, available anywhere, consistent explanations
