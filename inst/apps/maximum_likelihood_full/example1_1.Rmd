### A Simple Example of How ML Estimation Works

- Suppose we observed some data-producing system and disagreed on what distribution should be used to model the data produced by the process

    + You argue that a $WEIB(1.5,1)$ distribution should be used

    + I argue that an $EXP(1)$ distribution should be used
