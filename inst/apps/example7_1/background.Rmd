### Example 7.1 & 7.2 - Time Between $\alpha$-Particle Emissions

- Background

    - Berkson investigated the time between $\alpha$-particle emissions from the Americurium-241 radioisotope (AM-241)

    - Physics suggests that the interarrival times of $\alpha$ particles emitted from AM-241 are $iid\; EXP(\theta)$

- Data Set

    - The data are $10,220$ observed interarrival times (measured in units of $1/5000$ seconds)

    - The times were "binned" into one of 8 intervals corresponding to the duration between interarrivals

    - To illustrate the effect of sample size, random samples of size $n=20, 200,\;\&\;2000$ were drawn from the original data set.

- Figures

    + Figure 7.1 shows the exponential probability plots for the complete data set and each of the random samples
