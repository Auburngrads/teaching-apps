### Background of the SMRD package

- _SMRD_ derived from a software package called _SPLIDA_ (<u>S</u>-<u>P</u>lus <u>LI</u>fe <u>D</u>ata <u>A</u>nalysis)

    + _SPLIDA_ was written in S-Plus by [Dr. Bill Meeker](http://www.public.iastate.edu/~wqmeeker/homepage.html) during his career at Bell Labs and Iowa State University

    + Companion software to text 'Statistical Methods for Reliability Data' by Meeker & Escobar

    + GUI interface - plots and results were difficult to customize

    + The S/S-Plus language is the precursor to R

- Meeker later re-wrote _SPLIDA_ into R and renamed the package _RSplida_

    + Translation was rushed and incomplete

    + Retained many of the 'GUI' limitations of _SPLIDA_

    + Couldn't be used with RStudio
    
    + Not user-friendly

- In 2014, _RSplida_ was completely re-built and updated by Freels and renamed _SMRD_

    + _SMRD_ will be published to the CRAN in 2017 along with the 2^nd edition of the Meeker and Escobar text. 

    + Installing _SMRD_ requires the installation of two dependencies `plot3D` and `FSA`

    + In the R console, run `install.packages(c('plot3D','FSA'))`
